Test case fo Jest module separation
===================================

When running the code in Jest it starts to fail with "MY_GLOBAL is not defined" and also with issues when using instanceof since objects have been created in different contexts.

## Setup

    yarn

## Reproduce error

    yarn test


## Expected behavior

    yarn start
